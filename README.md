Encryption & Decryption: Protecting Digital Security
In today's digital age, securing data is more critical than ever. Encryption and Decryption are fundamental cryptographic techniques that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in digital communications. Encryption converts plain data into an unreadable format using cryptographic algorithms, making it accessible only to authorized parties with the correct decryption key. Decryption reverses this process, restoring the original information.
This repository provides comprehensive insights into various encryption methods, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing techniques, and practical implementations in programming languages. It covers widely used algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm), and more. Each implementation is designed to help developers understand encryption principles and integrate robust security measures into their applications.
Whether you're a security enthusiast, a developer looking to strengthen data protection in software, or someone curious about cryptography, this project offers code examples, explanations, and use cases that enhance your understanding of secure communication in modern technology.
